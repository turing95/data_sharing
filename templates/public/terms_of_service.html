The arbitrator may award relief only individually and only to the extent necessary to redress Customer’s or Kezyy’s individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief on behalf of others or the general public. Our past, present and future affiliates and agents may invoke our rights under this “Disputes” Section in the event they become involved in a dispute with you; otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties.</p>

If any part of this “Disputes” section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this “Disputes” section will be unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award according to this “Disputes” section, then only that respective claim or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s) for relief in arbitration.</p>
