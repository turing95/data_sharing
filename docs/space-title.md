# 1. Space Title

The Space title is mandatory and cannot be changed once set.  This title is significant in your communication with invitees:

- **Visibility to Invitees:**
  - The title appears on the invitees' upload page.
  - It is included in notifications, if sent to invitees.

- **Choosing an Effective Title:**
  - **Avoid vague titles** like "Space 1" or "File Space Request 1", as they lack specific information about the Space's purpose or content.
  - **Good examples** include:
    - "Invoices for Q4 2023"
    - "Technical Drawings for Proposal 767"
    - "Driving License Renewal Documents Upload Space"
