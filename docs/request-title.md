# 5.1 Request Title

- **Mandatory field**. Each request requires a specific title, which is a mandatory field. 
- **Visible to Invitees:** The request title is visible to invitees on the upload page and in notifications, if sent to invitees.
- **Characteristics of a Good Request Title:** Clearly indicates what the request is about without needing additional context not present in the space itself
- **Integration with Custom Naming:** 
  - The request title is one of the metadata elements that can be included in the custom name of the file (refer to the [Custom File Naming](TODO) section for more details).
- **Example usage:** In a Space collecting "Invoices for Q4 2023," you might title the first request as "October 2023 Invoices."
