# Notifications

### Types of Notifications

Kezyy offers two primary types of notifications, both aimed at invitees:

1. **Invitations to Spaces**
2. **Deadline Reminders**

### Invitation Notifications

- **Trigger and Content:**
  - Sent via email to invitees when a Space is created, if enabled during the setup process.
  - Includes:
    - Link to the Space.
    - Preview of the instructions and requests.
    - Deadline details, if applicable.
  - Can be manually re-sent

### Deadline Reminder Notifications

- **Trigger and Content:**
  - Sent via email based on settings specified during Space creation. (see [Space Deadline](pages/space/space-deadline) for more details)
  - Includes:
    - Link to the Space.
    - Preview of the instructions and requests.
    - Deadline details
  - Can be deactivated for individual invitees who have completed their uploads by making them "inactive". This prevents unnecessary reminders to those who have already submitted their files.
  - Can be sent manually

### **Manual Notification Sending:**
  - Both invitation and deadline reminder notifications can be manually sent to an invitee.
  - This is done on the [Space Summary](pages/space-summary-page) page by clicking on the invitee's email address and choosing the appropriate option from the resulting menu.
