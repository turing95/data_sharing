# Upload Page

Invitees access the Upload page via the Space link received in their invitation email or sent manually by you. This page is specifically tailored to provide all the necessary information for them to upload files correctly.

### Page Contents

- **Space Information:**
  - The Upload page prominently displays the Space title and instructions.
  - Details of the deadline, if applicable, are also shown.

- **Request Sections:**
  - Each request within the Space has its dedicated section, displaying:
    - Request title and specific instructions.
    - File type restrictions, if set.
    - A button to initiate the file selection process using a file picker.
    - A section to add notes about the files being uploaded.

### File Upload Process

- **File Selection and Confirmation:**
  - invitees can choose files from their PC to upload to a specific request.
  - Selected files are listed and require confirmation before uploading.
  - Files can be uploaded in batches, covering multiple requests in one action.
  - <u>There is a 50MB limit to the total size of files that can be uploaded in one go. Invitees can upload more files after the first batch but no file larger than 50MB can be uploaded.</u> 

- **Post-Upload Summary:**
  - After uploading, invitees can view a summary of their previously uploaded files.
  - This feature helps invitees track their submissions.

- **Public Link Limitations:**
  - For uploads via a public link, there is no upload history tracking.
  - This is due to the general and anonymous nature of public link submissions.
  - You will still be able to see the files uploaded via the [Space Summary](pages/space-summary-page) page.


### Dynamic updates and Access Limitations
  - The Upload page updates immediately with any edits made to the Space, like updated instructions or additional requests.
  - Invitees can return to upload more files at a later date.
  - Access limitations:
    - Post deadline: Page accessible but uploads can be disabled depending on the Space settings.
    - Space deletion or invitee deactivation: Page access denied.
