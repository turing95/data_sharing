# Managing Spaces

The "Your Spaces" page is where you land after logging in. It lists all the Spaces you've created. Initially, this will be empty for new users. Here's what you can do:

- **View Space Details:**
  - Each Space has a preview of the title and instructions.
  - Direct access to two key areas:
    - **[Summary Page](pages/space-summary-page):** Offers detailed information about the Space.
    - **Edit Page:** Enables you to modify the Space.

- **Manage Spaces:**
  - In the top right menu, a dropdown offers additional options.
  - **Delete a Space:**
    - Requires confirmation to ensure accidental deletions are avoided.
    - <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">**Important:** Deletion is permanent and not for archiving. Only delete Spaces that are no longer needed or were created by mistake.</span>

- **Navigating Through Spaces:**
  - If you can't see a Space, it might be on the next page.
  - Spaces are ordered by creation date, with the newest ones first.

- **Creating a New Space:**
  - The "New Space" button is at the top right.
  - Use this to create more Spaces, or your first one if none exist.
