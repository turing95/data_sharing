# 2. Invitations

- **Adding Invitees:**
  - Enter the email addresses of individuals who need to upload files.
  - A dedicated upload page will be created for each invitee.

- **Notification Toggle:**
  - There's an option to send an invitation notification to each invitee upon Space creation.
  - Enable the toggle button to activate this feature.
  - More details can be found in the "Notifications" article.

- **Public Link Option:**
  - A toggle button enables the creation of a public link.
  - This link isn't tied to specific email addresses and is useful for collecting files from an unspecified group of people.
  - Example use: Redirecting visitors from your website to upload logo suggestions, without requiring their email addresses.

- **Modifying the Invitee List:**
  - The list of invitees can be updated adding or removing them at any time.
