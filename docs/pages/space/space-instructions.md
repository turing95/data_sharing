# 3. Space Instructions

Check the [Request Instructions](pages/space/request/request-instructions) article for more details on how to guide invitees on what to upload.

- **Purpose of Space Instructions:**
  - For Spaces with multiple file requests, this section is for general instructions applicable to all requests.
  - If instructions are specific to a single file request, you can detail them in the request's instructions instead.
  - If you're only requesting a single file, you can include the instructions here and leave the request's instructions empty.

- **Content of Instructions:**
  - The instructions should be clear and concise, similar to what you would write in an email when making a file request.
  - It's the space to guide invitees on what needs to be uploaded and any specific details they should be aware of.

- **Example of Instructions:**
  - For a Space requesting "Q4 Invoices for 2023," you might include:
    >Please upload your invoices for Q4 2023 separating them by month (see requests below). Ensure each invoice is clearly labeled with the corresponding date and client name. Double check that the invoice belongs to the year 2023 before uploading. Thanks for your cooperation. For any questions contact me citing the Space title in the subject line.
