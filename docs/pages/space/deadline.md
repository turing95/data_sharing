# 4. Deadline

You can specify a due date and time for file submissions in your Space, using a user-friendly date picker.
- Setting a deadline is not mandatory.
- If you choose to set one, ensure it's a future date and time, as past deadlines prevent Space creation.

### **Deadline-Related Options:**
these options are only available if you set a deadline.
- **Notification Toggle:**
  - Activate this toggle to set up a reminder notification for the deadline.
  - Specify when the reminder should be sent in terms of days and hours before the deadline.
  >If the deadline is 9 p.m. on January 2nd, and you choose to send a reminder 1 day and 1 hour before, the notification will be sent on January 1st at 8 p.m.
- **Upload Restriction Toggle:**
  - By default, invitees can still upload files after the deadline.
  - Activate the toggle to prevent file uploads post-deadline.
  - Invitees attempting to access the Space after will be informed that the deadline has passed and uploads are no longer accepted.

### Benefits of Setting a Deadline

- **Encouraging Timely Submissions:**
  - A set deadline can motivate invitees to submit their files promptly.
  - It helps in maintaining the timeline of the project or process.

- **Gentle Reminders:**
  - Reminder notifications serve as a non-intrusive way to prompt invitees.
  - They eliminate the need for personal follow-ups, which can sometimes be awkward or strain relationships.
