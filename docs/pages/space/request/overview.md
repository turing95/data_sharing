# Requests in Kezyy

Requests allow you to specify what files or groups of files you need from invitees.
- Each new Space automatically includes one default request that you can customize
-  **Adding More Requests:**
  - Additional requests can be added by clicking the "Add Request" button, located at the bottom left of the last request.
  - This allows for handling multiple file types or categories within the same Space.

### Purpose of Separate Requests

- Each request in a Space is meant to address a distinct file submission need. This could be due to various reasons like:
  - Requiring a different naming convention for files.
  - Needing specific instructions for a particular set of files.
  - Directing files to different destination folders in your cloud storage.

Check out the settings available for each request in the following sections.
