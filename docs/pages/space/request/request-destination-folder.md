# 5.2 Request Destination Folder

The destination folder is where the files uploaded by invitees for a request will be stored within your cloud storage system.

- **Selecting the Destination Folder:**
  - Choose your cloud storage provider (Google Drive or OneDrive) based on your preferences set in the [Settings page](pages/settings) about the cloud storage providers connections.
  - Use the search bar to find the folder by title. This search works regardless of the folder's nesting level.
  - Once you have selected the folder, you will see the folder's title on the left of the search bar.

### Key Considerations

<div style="text-align:center; background-color:#FFCCCC; padding:10px; margin:10px auto; width:75%;">
    <span style="color:#CC0000; font-weight:bold;">Do not delete destination folders unless you know what you are doing</span>
</div>



- **Maintaining the Destination Folder:**
  - It is crucial not to delete the destination folder in your cloud storage.
  - Renaming is permissible, but deletion disrupts the file upload process for invitees.
  - If a folder is deleted, invitees can no longer see or upload files to the request because there is no valid destination.

- **Changing the Destination Folder:**
  - If you need to delete a destination folder, first update the Space to change the request's destination folder.
  - Failing to update the Space will prevent invitees from uploading files.
