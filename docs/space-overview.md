# Creating a Space in Kezyy

When you click on "New Space," you begin setting up an Upload Space in Kezyy. The aim is to streamline the process for invitees to upload files, providing them with clear instructions and making it easier for you to process the files they submit.

## Overview

Invitees access a Space through a web link, leading to a dedicated upload page with detailed instructions for submitting the required files. In setting up a new Space, the following elements are mandatory:

1. **Space Title:**
   - Each Space must have a unique title.
   - This title is visible to invitees and serves as the primary identifier of the Space.
   - **Important:** The title cannot be changed once set.

2. **File Request Title:**
   - You can create one or more file requests within a Space.
   - Each request needs a distinct title.

3. **Destination for File Request:**
   - Assign a specific folder in your cloud storage for each request's files.
   - Files submitted through a request will be sent to this folder.

After these foundational elements are in place, we can explore the additional features and settings available on this page and their implications.
